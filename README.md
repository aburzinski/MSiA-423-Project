## Project Charter
### Vision
This project will predict the success of MLB players to help MLB teams with player management.
### Mission
This project will use 50 years of historical MLB to predict success among players.  Specifically, this project will use logistic regression models to predict winners of MLB awards such as MVP, the Cy Young Award, and Golden Glove awards.
### Success Criteria
- The success of the logistic regression models used will be based on the AUC measure.
- The success of the app with respect to the business outcome will be usage metrics.  These metrics include how many MLB teams use the app,  how many teams repeatedly use the app, and how many player decisions are made based on the app.
